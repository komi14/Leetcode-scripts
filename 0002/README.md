Adding Two numbers in Python
# Program 01
In the program, we've used the + operator to add two numbers.

# Program 02
In this program, we asked the user to enter two numbers and this program displays the sum of two numbers entered by user.

We use the built-in function input() to take the input. Since, input() returns a string, we convert the string into number using the float() function. Then, the numbers are added.

Alternative to this, we can perform this addition in a single statement without using any variables.
